- you just made the UI snazzy and took out all the manual controls
- your next mission is to make devices dynamic.  you should be able to unplug the gantry and the gantry status should disappear and all the gantry messages should leave the command reference
- each device should be defined by a single .py file, for their status panel and acceptable commands and all that
- devices should be hot swappable and the script validator needs to be able to throw errors if there are commands in the script that don't match the devices connected
